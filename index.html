      Hi, I'm Lalit Jain a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
    </p>

    <p> My research interests revolve around algebraic geometry, topology  and number theory. Recently I have also been exploring applications of geometry to machine learning. These days I spend most of my time thinking about monodromy, cycles on moduli spaces, and theoretical problems in the world of active learning. My advisor is <a href="math.wisc.edu/~ellenberg">Jordan Ellenberg</a> and I have also been working with <a href="nowak.ece.wisc.edu">Robert Nowak.</a></p>
