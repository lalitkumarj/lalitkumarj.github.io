      Hi, I'm Lalit Jain, a Postdoc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.
    </p>

    <p> My research focuses on developing new machine learning algorithms and systems for practitioners who need to collect expensive experimental data under limited budget constraints. I combine theoretical mathematical insights with practical implementations to develop methods that effectively provide statistical insights in far fewer measurements than naive passive data collection methods. This work has been applied to optimizing crowdfunding and microlending platforms, measuring conceptual perception in cognitive psychology, detecting humor in jokes, and controlling false discovery rate in experimental platforms.  </p>

    <p> <b>Bio:</b> I'm currently a member of <a href='https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jamieson/about.html'>Professor Kevin Jamieson's group</a>. Before coming to UW, I was a postdoc at the University of Michigan mentored by <a href="https://annacgilbert.github.io/">Professor Anna Gilbert</a>. My PhD in Mathematics was advised by Professor <a href="http://math.wisc.edu/~ellenber">Jordan Ellenberg</a> and  Professor <a href="http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu">Robert Nowak.</a></p>

    <p> Previously, I was a Teach for America corps member in San Francisco at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School. I used to teach for the San Francisco and Oakland Math Circles and I was an organizer for Madison Math Circles. Educational equity is something I am very passionate about and love to discuss. </p>
