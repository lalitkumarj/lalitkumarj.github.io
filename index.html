      Hi, I'm Lalit Jain, a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Michigan. 
    </p>

    <p> My research interests revolve around algebraic geometry, number theory, and machine learning. These days I spend most of my time thinking about monodromy, randking and embedding problems, random graphs and active learning. My advisor in grad school was Professor <a href="http://math.wisc.edu/~ellenber">Jordan Ellenberg</a> and I also worked closely with Professor <a href="http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu">Robert Nowak.</a></p>

    <p>You can download a copy of my <a href="/files/LalitJainCVWebsite.pdf">CV here</a>.

    <p> My previous career was as a Teach for America corps member in San Francisco at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School. I used to teach for the San Francisco and Oakland Math Circles and I was an organizer for Madison Math Circles. Educational equity is something I am very passionate about and love to discuss. </p>
