      Hi, I'm Lalit Jain, a postdoc in mathematics at the University of Michigan. 
    </p>

    <p> I'm currently a member of Professor Anna Gilbert's group at the University of Michigan. These days I spend most of my time thinking about metric learning, ordinal embedding, ranking and bandits, active learning systems, and random graphs. My PhD advisor was Professor <a href="http://math.wisc.edu/~ellenber">Jordan Ellenberg</a> and I also worked closely with Professor <a href="http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu">Robert Nowak.</a></p> 

    <p>You can download a copy of my <a href="/files/LalitJainCVWebsite.pdf">CV here</a>.

    <p> Previously, I was a Teach for America corps member in San Francisco at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School. I used to teach for the San Francisco and Oakland Math Circles and I was an organizer for Madison Math Circles. Educational equity is something I am very passionate about and love to discuss. </p>
