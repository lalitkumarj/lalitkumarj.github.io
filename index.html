      Hi, I'm Lalit Jain, a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. 
    </p>

    <p> My research interests revolve around algebraic geometry, topology  and number theory. Recently I have also been exploring applications of geometry to machine learning. These days I spend most of my time thinking about monodromy, cycles on moduli spaces, and theoretical problems in the world of active learning. My advisor is <a href="http://math.wisc.edu/~ellenberg">Jordan Ellenberg</a> and I have also been working with <a href="http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu">Robert Nowak.</a></p>

    <p>You can download a copy of my <a href="/files/CVLalitJain.pdf">CV here</a> and a copy of my <a href="/files/LalitJainResume.pdf">resume here</a>.</p>

    <p> My previous career was as a Teach for America corps member in San Francisco at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School. I used to teach for the San Francisco and Oakland Math Circles and I was an organizer for Madison Math Circles. Educational equity is something I am very passionate about and love to discuss. </p>
