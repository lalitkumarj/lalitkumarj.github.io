      Hi, I'm Lalit Jain, a Postdoc in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.
    </p>

    <p> I'm currently a member of Professor Kevin Jamieson's group. These days I spend most of my time thinking about multi-armed bandit problems, applications of adaptive data collection, and metric learning for representation. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Michigan mentored by Professor Anna Gilbert. My PhD advisor was Professor <a href="http://math.wisc.edu/~ellenber">Jordan Ellenberg</a> and I also worked closely with Professor <a href="http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu">Robert Nowak.</a></p>

    <p>You can download a copy of my <a href="/files/LalitJainCVWebsite.pdf">CV here</a>.

    <p> Previously, I was a Teach for America corps member in San Francisco at Ida B. Wells Continuation High School. I used to teach for the San Francisco and Oakland Math Circles and I was an organizer for Madison Math Circles. Educational equity is something I am very passionate about and love to discuss. </p>
