# Adaptive Experimentation in Practice

This course is about the algorithms and techniques that drive experimentation in online platforms. At many firms, thousands of experiments are run daily to gather the vast amount of data needed to enable data-driven decision making. For any one of these experiments, an experimenter faces the challenge of deciding what data to collect, how long to run the experiment, and how to glean insights from the data collected. As a result, there is an increased demand by practitioners for methods and algorithms that deliver statistically sound results faster and with less opportunity cost. This course develops a modern toolbox of experimentation, with a focus on *adaptive experimental design*. Rooted in classical statistical and machine learning techniques, AED decides what future data to collect based on past measurements in a closed loop. Due to both theoretical gains and empirical success, AED has quickly become one of the most commonly employed algorithmic paradigms in practice with a promise of cutting experimentation time by up to half. However, practitioners who employ AED blindly can easily bias their results, or potentially not collect the data needed to make any useful inferences.  

Students who take this course will learn how to a) design choose and develop adaptive experiments in practice, b) analyze the data coming from these experiments, c) conduct research in cutting-edge directions in AED.

Topics include:

- Sequential Experimentation
- Multi-armed and Contextual Bandits
- Interference in Experiments
- Multiple Hypothesis Testing
- Off-Policy Evaluation
- Orthogonal/Double Machine Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Class sessions will be a mix of lecture and discussion of papers. There will be homeworks focused on implementing algorithms.
